                    "Rogue One" received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences.
                    The film was praised for its darker and more war-themed tone compared to other Star Wars films.
                    The performances, especially that of Felicity Jones, were well-received, and the film was lauded for its impressive visual effects and action sequences.
                    Some critics appreciated the way the movie seamlessly connected with the original trilogy, enhancing the overall Star Wars saga. However, a few critiques mentioned pacing issues and a relatively slow start.
                    The film's contribution to the Star Wars lore, filling in a crucial gap in the storyline, was appreciated by fans, and it has become a significant part of the franchise's expanded universe.
