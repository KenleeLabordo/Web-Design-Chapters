Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

1. An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.

2. A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).

3. A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.

4. Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
At least two classes.
 
5. One link styled as a button.
